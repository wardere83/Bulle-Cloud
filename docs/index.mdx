description: "BrowserOS is an AI-powered browser that turns your words into actions. A privacy-first alternative to Chrome, Perplexity Comet, Dia."

We believe browsers should be open source and privacy-first — not tracking software for search or ad companies. The future is agents that automate your work locally and securely. We're building the best browser for that future.

## Key Features

<Accordion title="🪄 Build agents with natural language">
  Automate any task—from scraping websites to filling out forms—just by describing what you want to do in plain language. BrowserOS translates your words into a repeatable agent that runs locally, giving you custom automation without code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🪟 Use ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. in Split-View">
  Summarize articles, draft documents, or get answers without ever leaving the page you are on by opening your favorite AI model in a side panel – ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude or Grok!
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔌 Install any MCP server">
  BrowserOS comes with pre-installed MCP servers for Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, and Notion. One-click install any other MCP server — your browser becomes the command center for all work tools.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🧠 Next-gen productivity">
  Turn your browser into a second brain — search history and bookmarks by meaning, not just keywords. The built-in highlighter keeps important bits right where you found them. No more lost research.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🛡️ True privacy with local LLMs">
  Run models locally with Ollama or bring your own API keys for cloud models. Your company and work data stay on your machine unless you choose to send it out.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="👔 Your executive assistant, built in">
  Our built-in AI assistant connects to your work apps like Gmail and Calendar to draft replies and schedule meetings. You focus on the real work — your browser handles the rest.
</Accordion>
