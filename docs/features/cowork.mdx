Filesystem Access lets you describe complex tasks and let the agent handle them end-to-end. Combine browser automation with local file operations — research on the web, then save reports directly to your folder.

## Why Filesystem Access?

Without Filesystem Access, the agent can only interact with browser tabs. With Filesystem Access enabled, it gains full access to a folder on your machine:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Read files" icon="file-import">
    Access documents, data files, and more from your selected folder
  </Card>
  <Card title="Write files" icon="file-export">
    Save reports, spreadsheets, markdown, HTML, and other outputs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Run commands" icon="terminal">
    Execute shell commands within the folder
  </Card>
</Columns>

The real power: do both browser automation AND file operations in a single task. Describe what you want, step away, and come back to finished work.

## Setting Up Filesystem Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Filesystem Access selector">
    Click the **Filesystem Access** dropdown next to the prompt input
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a folder">
    Select a recent folder or click **Choose a different folder**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant access">
    Allow BrowserOS to access that folder when prompted
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

The agent is sandboxed to your selected folder — it cannot access files outside of it.

<Tip>
To disable file access, select **No folder** and the agent will work with browser tabs only.

## Try It: Research and Create a Report

With Filesystem Access enabled, try this prompt:

```
Read the top 3 stories on Hacker News, read the comments too, and write an HTML report.
```

The agent will:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Hacker News">
    Opens the site and identifies top stories
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read stories and comments">
    Clicks into each story and reads discussion threads
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate report">
    Creates an HTML report summarizing the findings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save to folder">
    Writes the report to your selected folder
  </Step>
</Steps>
