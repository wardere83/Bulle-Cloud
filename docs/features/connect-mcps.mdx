description: "Link your apps to BrowserOS so the assistant can read data and take actions"
---

Connect your favorite apps to BrowserOS so the assistant can read your emails, check your calendar, post to Slack, update Notion, and more — all through natural conversation.

## What is MCP?

BrowserOS Connected Apps use the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external systems. Think of it as a single, consistent way to plug your apps into the assistant.

## Built-in Apps

- **Gmail** — Send, read, and search emails
- **Google Calendar** — Create events, check your schedule
- **Google Docs** — Create and edit documents
- **Google Sheets** — Create and edit spreadsheets
- **Google Drive** — Upload, download, and manage files
- **Slack** — Post messages, manage channels
- **Notion** — Create pages, manage databases
- **LinkedIn** — Post updates, manage connections

## Connect a Built-in App

1. Go to **Settings → Connected Apps**
2. Click **Add built-in app** and select the app
3. Sign in and authorize BrowserOS

## Use Connected Apps

Just ask the assistant what you want — it will automatically use the right connected apps.

## Add a Custom MCP Server

You can connect any MCP-compatible server that exposes an SSE endpoint.

1. Go to **Settings → Connected Apps**
2. Click **Add custom app**
3. Enter your server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/sse`) and give it a name

Custom servers appear alongside built-in apps and work the same way.

<Tip>
MCP has a growing ecosystem of servers. Browse [MCP servers on GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) to find integrations for databases, APIs, and more.
</Tip>

### Connect to OAuth-Protected Remote Servers

Some remote MCP servers (like Atlassian Jira, GitHub, etc.) require OAuth authentication. Use [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) and [supergateway](https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway) to handle the OAuth flow locally:

```bash
npx -y supergateway --stdio "npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse" --port 8000
```

A browser window will open to sign in. Once authenticated, add `http://localhost:8000/sse` as a custom MCP in BrowserOS.

<Note>
Keep the terminal running while you use BrowserOS. The local server handles authentication and proxies requests to the remote MCP server.

    ```bash
    npx -y supergateway --stdio "npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse" --port 8000
    ```
    Then add `http://localhost:8000/sse` as a custom MCP.
