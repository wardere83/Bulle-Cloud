BrowserOS supports full ad blocking through [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), the most effective open-source ad blocker available.

## How It Works

Chrome has been [phasing out support](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/mv2-deprecation-timeline) for Manifest V2 extensions, which uBlock Origin relies on for its full blocking capabilities. We re-enabled Manifest V2 support in BrowserOS so uBlock Origin can run at full power.

Install it from the Chrome Web Store: [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)

## BrowserOS vs Chrome

We ran both browsers through [adblock.turtlecute.org](https://adblock.turtlecute.org/), a test that measures how effectively a browser blocks ads and tracking scripts.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="BrowserOS — 68%">
    <img src="/images/adblock-browseros.png" alt="BrowserOS blocking 68% of ads" />
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chrome — 7%">
    <img src="/images/adblock-chrome.png" alt="Chrome blocking only 7% of ads" />
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Out of 133 ad-related requests:
- **BrowserOS** blocked 91 (68%)
- **Chrome** blocked 9 (7%)

That's roughly **10x more protection** with zero configuration.

## What This Means

Fewer ads means faster page loads, less bandwidth usage, and significantly reduced tracking. BrowserOS handles this natively so you can focus on browsing.
